I think the program wants to check each integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than the input number and return 4 different values based on following situations:
  (1) return 'FizzBuzz' if it is the mutiple of both 3 and 5;
  (2) return 'Fuzz' if it is mutiple of 3 not 5;
  (3) return 'Buzz' if it is the mutiple of 5 not 3;
  (4) otherwise,return the integer itself.

Also, the program considers the situation when the input is not a number and then raise an error.

The result of running this program will always print failed. So I made following changes:
(1) Check if the input is a positive integer(line 19-20) before the for loop,while inside the function check(a), line 2 if statement is always false;
(2) In the for loop(line 23), xrange() only takes integers as parameters and sys.argv[0] is the name of the source code file, e.g. command line python code_review.py 15, sys.argv[0] returns "code_review.py" and sys.argv[1] returns "15". So it should be xrange(1,int(sys.argv[1])) returning a sequence of numbers between 1 and input number(exlusive).
(3) Change to u'FizzBuzz' in line 4 for consistence with line 6 and 8, which use unicode characters.

Test cases are:
python code_review_revised.py 3
python code_review_revised.py 5
python code_review_revised.py 15
python code_review_revised.py 15.6
python code_review_revised.py helloworld
python code_review_revised.py -1
